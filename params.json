From my point of view [current server applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UPnP_AV_media_servers_and_clients#UPnP_AV_media_servers) are over-engineered. This should not be THAT hard to deliver media content over a local network.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Configuration file\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Install as a service\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nTODO Write about multi-interface machines","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
